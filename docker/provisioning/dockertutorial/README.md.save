#Container
Start by pulling this repo and this directory (DockerTutorial)
This starts by running one container, to running a swarm 
I run my own local docker registry by running this in my terminal: 
> docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2

From this directory, run this in the terminal to build the dockr image: 
> docker build -t friendlyhello .

After building an image, the container can be ran in detached mode (get back to the terminal) by: 
> docker run -d -p 4000:80 friendlyhello

To push this up to the local registry (similar to committing and tag the commit): 
> docker tag friendlyhello localhost:5000/friendlyhello  
> docker push localhost:5000/friendlyhello  

Note: pushing may take a couple of minutes with the size of the docker registry.

From there it's possible to stop the running container and remove the images
> docker container ls  
> docker container stop ${CONTAINER ID}   
> docker image remove friendlyhello  
> docker image remove localhost:5000/friendlyhello  

It's easy to pull the image back now and use it again or just b y running it the image will be pulled
> docker pull localhost:5000/friendlyhello  
> docker run -d -p 4000:80 localhost:5000/friendlyhello   


#Swarm
This is dependent on previous steps and having a local registry setup.  
Things may have gotten a bit dirty so to cleanup all stopped containers
> docker ps -aq --no-trunc -f status=exited | xargs docker rm  
Make a lead node by
> docker swarm init
Then get the service started by 
> docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml friendlyhelloswarm 

Wait a few minutes then go to localhost:4000 and youw ill see the docker container ID changes with each refresh
To check if the containers are up and running, run: 
> docker service ls
You should see that there are 5/5 replicas running
